Hello friend! Nice to see you here!

Let me tell you a bit about myself. I am a masters student in [The Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.vt.edu/ "The Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering") at [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu/ "VT") conducting research in Computer Vision using Deep Learning architectures under the guidance of [Dr. A.L. Abbott](https://ece.vt.edu/people/profile/abbott "ala"). I work on solving problems related to [panoptic image segmentation](https://cocodataset.org/#panoptic-2019 "panoptic") and scene understanding which have applications across a broad range of domains. I worked as a Research Intern at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Prime-Air/b?ie=UTF8&node=8037720011 "APA") last summer and have TA'd for some highly popular courses such as [Computer Vision](https://ece.vt.edu/grad/courses/5554 "CV") and [Artificial Intelligence](https://computing.ece.vt.edu/~abbott/teaching/ece4524/p1/ "AI") at Virginia Tech. When I'm not in front of a computer, I play semi-professional soccer, click some photos and explore the exciting field of Cosmology. I hope to experience interstellar travel someday (hope :P). If you're visiting this page, it is highly likely that we share some common interest and could help each other. I'd love it if we connected via some social channel. My info is to the left.

Look forward to meeting you! Cheers!
